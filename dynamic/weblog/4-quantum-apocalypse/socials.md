Just had the pleasure to present my session about quantum cryptography at @BaselOne today!

Did you miss it? No worries! I've written a blog post to accompany the talk, which looks beyond the hype and buzzwords to provide a technical understanding of what's really going on. This way, you can make up your own mind about the quantum threats towards cryptography.

With NIST finalizing their first post quantum secure cryptographic algorithms a couple of months ago, the quantum threat is a hotter topic than ever. I've written a blog post that aims to look beyond the hype and buzzwords and provide an actual technical understanding of what's happening, such that you can make up your own mind about it. Don't hesitate to give me feedback on how you liked it:
